## Solder Mod Updator [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/fcpwiz/SolderModUpdater.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/fcpwiz/SolderModUpdater)

I would like to introduce you to 'Solder Mod Updater'. This app lets you select a .jar file, then the app properly sets the .jar up to work in the Solder repo. The final output .zip gets sent to a folder on your desktop called "Finished Mods". This will significantly speed up updating a large quantity of mods. This app if for mac only, I think.
